# Create a counter class

## TODO:

1. Counter should be a ES6 class
2. Counter should store current number in `number` property of the instance.
3. Counter should start from `0` or value specified in first argument of the constructor.
4. Counter have `.inc` method that bumps the stored number by `1`.
4. Counter have `.dec` method that decreases the stored number by `1`.
5. Counter have `.reset` method overwrite that number to `0`.
